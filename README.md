# kine's config files, &c.

## about

After a somewhat haphazardly planned upgrade to OS X Lion, i found myself having to hunt down several config files and various related things in my back-ups. Having seen a few other repositories containing things of this nature, i decided i'd create one of my own.

I'm not sure if anyone else will ever get any use out of any of these files — they're mostly for my own benefit after all — but feel free to do anything you like with them. All of it, except where otherwise noted, is released under the terms of the [WTFPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL).
